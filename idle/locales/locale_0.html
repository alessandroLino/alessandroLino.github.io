    <p class="capital">The Shatterglass Fens stretch across a low, mist-choked basin where sunlight filters through in
        fractured beams.
        The
        water here lies unnervingly still, its surface broken only by narrow paths of cracked mud and the sharp, jagged
        patterns
        of mineral sheen that earned the Fens their name. At a glance, the wetland seems like a shattered mirror strewn
        across
        the earth. Step too fast, and the ground itself may twist beneath your feet — the soil behaves more like a
        living thing,
        as if reluctantly tolerating the presence of trespassers.

        The air hangs heavy with moisture and a faint chemical tang, while the soundscape is an eerie blend of croaking
        echoes
        and distant, bubbling shifts beneath the muck. Luminous reeds line the water’s edge, glowing with a soft
        bioluminescence. They pulse slowly in rhythm, as if breathing — some say they react to emotion, others believe
        they’re
        rooted in something older and more intelligent than plants have any right to be.

        While the Fens are known for their quiet beauty, they are treacherous and unwelcoming to the unprepared.</p>
    <h1>Inhabitants</h1>

    <h3>Will-o-wisp</h3>
    <a href="https://androidarts.com/">Teste</a>
    <p>
        Pale blue lights that dance just out of reach, often mistaken for fireflies or soul-lanterns. They lead
        wanderers into
        deep water or unstable bogs. Some claim they are the spirits of those who drowned in the Fens, others argue they
        are
        intelligent predators feeding on confusion and fear. They rarely attack directly — their weapon is misdirection.

    <h3>Bog Serpents</h3>

        <p>
            Long, slick, and almost entirely silent beneath the water, these creatures resemble enormous eels with
            segmented plating
            and mossy frills. Their eyes are lidless and fixed, peering just above the surface before striking like a
            whip. Though
            solitary, they are relentless once provoked. The older ones are covered in barnacle-like growths and
            trailing strands of
            luminous moss, blending in with the glowing wetlands.

    <h3>Swamp Myconid</h3>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
        <p>
            Fungal beings that stand in silence like ancient totems, often mistaken for rotted tree stumps. They thrive
            in clusters
            and emit spores that cause hallucinations or disorientation. Myconids communicate through pheromones and
            spore clouds,
            and are rumored to be guardians of something buried deep beneath the Fens — perhaps a greater fungal mind,
            or something
            left behind by a long-forgotten civilization. Though slow, they are not defenseless, and some have been seen
            wielding
            weapons made from bone and petrified wood.
