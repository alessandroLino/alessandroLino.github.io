    <title>The Embervault Catacombs</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p class="capital">Beneath the scorched ridgelands lies a labyrinthine necropolis carved deep into volcanic stone —
        the Embervault
        Catacombs, a resting place for forgotten empires and cursed dynasties. The walls are scorched and dry, etched
        with
        crumbling sigils and ossified scripture. Embervein ore lines the ceilings, releasing a constant, eerie glow in
        the form
        of drifting sparks and ember motes. These embers drift like fireflies, but without heat — only light, flickering
        in
        patterns that many believe form words in a language long lost to man or god.</p>

    <p class="capital">The silence here is dense and smothering. Only the soft hiss of emberfall and the occasional
        groan of shifting
        stone
        break the tomb's oppressive quiet. Some corridors have collapsed, others twist impossibly, as if the very layout
        shifts
        with time. Treasures lie buried with their owners, wrapped in cloth and curse, while offerings left behind by
        misguided
        looters lie untouched beside scorched boots or gnawed bones.

        Few enter willingly. Fewer return unchanged.</p>

    <h1>Inhabitants</h1>

    <h3>Ash Revenants</h3>
    <p>
        Skeletal beings cloaked in soot, animated by hatred and memory. Their bones are blackened and cracked, their
        armor
        half-melted into their frames. Ash Revenants don’t patrol — they wait. Lurking within open tombs or beneath
        scattered
        ash, they rise only when disturbed, reliving their final moments in a haze of vengeance. They burn with a hatred
        that
        doesn’t consume flesh, but hope.

    <h3>Ember Spirit</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Ethereal wisps of flame with vague humanoid shapes, bound to the embervein ore. They drift silently through
        the air or
        cling to the ceilings like burning bats. When angered, they erupt into bursts of radiant flame, burning soul
        before
        skin. Some believe they were once the spirits of high priests who offered themselves to the flame to
        preserve their
        kingdom's power.

    <h3>Scavenger Rats</h3>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
        <img src='../images/rat.png' style="float: left; width: 30%; margin: 8px;" />
        <p>
            Gaunt, hairless things with ember-glowing eyes. These creatures have adapted to the heat and ash, nesting in
            crypts and
            feeding on offerings, remains, and even weakened spirits. They often move in swarms, coordinated and silent,
            their tiny
            feet leaving no prints on the soot-covered floors. When they sense weakness, they strike with surgical
            cruelty.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Bone Wraiths</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Shadows given form by hatred. Bone Wraiths glide just above the floor, their skeletal forms encased in thin,
        cracking
        armor. They utter no sound, but their presence brings a cold pressure, as if the tomb itself is watching. When
        they
        attack, it’s with precise, spectral blades that leave no wound, only numbness and soul-deep fear.
    </p>

    <h3>Flicker Wisps</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Tiny, erratic sparks that flit through the catacombs like playful ghosts. Often mistaken for harmless embers,
        they are
        drawn to movement and emotion. When gathered in groups, they can disrupt magical wards, short out
        flame-resistant wards,
        or ignite volatile materials. In high enough numbers, they swirl into flame cyclones with minds of their own.
