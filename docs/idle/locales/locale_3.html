        Once the bustling heart of a thriving trade route, Siltgrave Market now lies half-swallowed by the desert's
        relentless
        tides. Time seems arrested here — stalls still stand beneath sun-bleached canopies, and the scent of rare spices
        lingers
        faintly in the dry air. Trinkets and baubles remain untouched on weathered carts, as though waiting for their
        final
        sale. The whispers of long-dead merchants drift on the wind, some beckoning with deals too good to be true,
        others
        locked in ghostly barters that never end.

        Mirages ripple across the sand-choked avenues, sometimes revealing flashes of the market in its golden prime.
        Travelers
        who linger too long risk losing track of reality — or worse, bartering pieces of themselves in otherworldly
        trades.

        Strange disturbances in the sand betray unseen movement below. The entire market feels watched, as if the very
        air
        expects a transaction... and exacts a price.

    <h1>Inhabitants</h1>

    <h3>Sand Shades</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Wraithlike remnants of traders and thieves who died clutching their goods. They flicker between visibility,
        attacking
        from blind angles or slipping into illusions of the living.
    </p>

    <h3>Burrowing Scarabs</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Chitinous swarms that tunnel beneath the sand, bursting out to overwhelm intruders. Their shimmering shells
        resemble
        lost coins, luring the greedy.
    </p>

    <h3>Mirage Djinns</h3>

        <p class="capital">
            Cunning spirits bound to forgotten contracts. They offer travelers powerful boons... but their favors always
            carry a
            hidden cost.
        </p>



        <h3>Dune Vipers</h3>
        <p class="capital">
            Long, whip-thin serpents that blend perfectly into the sand. Their venom causes hallucinations of prosperity
            or
            doom.
        </p>

        <h3>Lost traders</h3>
        <p class="capital">
            Semi-sentient echoes of past merchants, trapped in endless routines. Some may trade, others beg for escape,
            and
            a few
            lash out in madness.
        </p>

        <h3>Glass Beetle</h3>
        <div style="overflow: hidden;">
            <img src='https://alessandrolino.github.io/idle/images/glassbeetlelr.png'
                style="float: right; width: 40%;" />
            <p class="capital">
                Translucent insectoids whose carapaces refract light into hypnotic patterns. Often found crawling across
                abandoned
                relics or mimicking shiny objects.
