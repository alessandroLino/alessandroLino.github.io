    <title>The Hollow Spine Ridge</title>

    <p class="capital">Rising like the fractured ribs of the earth itself, the The Hollow Spine Ridge stretch high into
        the
        storm-scarred skies. Each
        towering stone spire resembles a colossal vertebra, as if the skeleton of a fallen titan were buried upright in
        the
        earth. The range is jagged and treacherous, crisscrossed by narrow ledges, knife-thin ridges, and sudden drops
        into
        cloud-choked gulches. Travelers often describe the unsettling feeling of being watched — not just by beasts, but
        by the
        mountains themselves.

        The wind here never ceases. It howls through the crevices and hollows, carrying with it strange, distorted
        echoes.
        Voices are returned twisted and unfamiliar, as though spoken by unseen watchers. Some say the winds whisper
        secrets — or
        lures.

        The land is charged with residual magnetism. Compasses spin uselessly, and metallic gear is known to hum or
        shift with a
        will of its own. The peaks are strewn with shattered relics — rusted swords bent like ribbon, broken armor fused
        with
        stone, and devices from long-dead civilizations cracked and scattered like dry bones. These remnants suggest
        that the
        range was once the site of a battle — or a cataclysm — whose cause remains unknown.</p>

    <h1>Inhabitants</h1>

    <h3>Stone Golems</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Towering constructs of jagged rock and glowing fault lines, these ancient guardians stand motionless for years,
        mistaken
        for spires themselves. They awaken only when their territory is trespassed or disturbed, moving with thunderous
        intent.
        Some bear inscriptions in forgotten languages, hinting at their creators. Their attacks are slow but
        devastating, and
        they are nearly impervious to conventional weapons.
    </p>



    <h3>Rock Wraith</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Ethereal figures that phase in and out of the stone walls. They resemble drifting silhouettes of those who
        perished here
        — warriors, travelers, or worse. Rock Wraiths possess the uncanny ability to slide through rock faces, attacking
        from
        unexpected angles. They can sap the warmth from a body and sow hallucinations that make ledges seem safe — or
        safety
        seem unattainable.

    <h3>Harpies</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Winged predators with shrieking cries and knotted talons, the harpies of Spinecrag build their nests on the
        highest,
        most inaccessible cliffs. Unlike their distant cousins found in warmer climates, these are pallid and thin,
        adapted to
        the cold wind and thin air. They hunt by confusing prey with their mimicry of human voices, luring the unwary
        toward
        perilous drops.

    <h3>Cliff Stalker</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Four-limbed predators, lean and muscular, with obsidian-black hides that shimmer like glass. They cling to sheer
        walls
        effortlessly, silently stalking intruders. When they strike, it is fast and fatal — a blur of fangs and claws.
        Their
        lairs are often marked by bone piles and scattered fragments of gear half-melted by unknown enzymes.
    </p>

    <h3>Iron Scarab</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Mechanical or semi-organic creatures resembling beetles, often found clustered around the magnetic anomalies.
        They feed
        on metal, stripping weapons, armor, and even coins down to nothing. Some are drawn to the smallest vibrations,
        swarming
        with terrifying precision. When threatened, they emit a piercing, harmonic pulse that disorients both man and
        beast.
    </p>

    <h3>Whispering Spirits</h3>

        <p class="capital">
            The disembodied remnants of those lost to the peaks, these spirits do not speak in words but instead seed
            thoughts and
            emotions. They are often heard in the wind, not seen, and their presence causes memory lapses or
            inexplicable
            dread.
            Some believe they serve the peaks themselves, guiding outsiders toward their doom — or protecting some
            secret
            deep
            within the stone.
