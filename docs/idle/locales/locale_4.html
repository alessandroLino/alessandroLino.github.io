        <p class="capital">
            Rising above the encroaching forest canopy, the Verdigris Observatory is a forgotten remnant of arcane
            stargazing, its domed summit now cloaked in green-streaked copper and trailing ivy. Once a marvel of
            precision engineering and magical astronomy, the tower now hums with a quiet, uncanny tension — as if time
            itself were holding its breath.
        <p>
            Within its chambers, the air shimmers with an unseen pressure. Brass rings of shattered armillary spheres
            turn slowly without touch, their runes flickering dimly with residual starlight. Moss-covered stone steps
            wind past walls lined with celestial charts now faded and warped, their constellations whispering to those
            who dare study them too
            closely.
        </p>

        <p>
            The copper devices, once polished to a mirror shine, are now oxidized and dulled — save for the occasional
            gleam, as if in defiance of their age.
        </p>

        <p>
            The observatory is far from lifeless.
        </p>

        <p class="capital">
            Outside, the ruins of satellite observatories peek from the underbrush, and strange glyphs bloom across
            stones at night.
            Atop the highest dome, the great telescope — now frozen in place — points unwaveringly at a single patch of
            sky, where
            no star has shone for a thousand years.
        </p>

            To stand at the heart of Verdigris Observatory is to feel watched — not by any living being, but by the
            cosmos itself.

    <h1>Inhabitants</h1>

    <h3>Armillary Constructs</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Forged of brass and arcane energy, drift silently through the halls, continuing their measurements and
        calibrations long
        after their creators vanished. They seem unaware — or perhaps unconcerned — with the passage of time or
        intruding visitors.
    </p>

    <img src='{embedImage:revenant.png}' />

    <h3>Rust Beetle</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Scuttle across metal fixtures and collapsed scaffolding, drawn to the oxidized copper like moths to flame. Their
        carapaces glint with patina, and their gnawing mandibles are strong enough to weaken even enchanted alloys.
    </p>

    <h3>Wandering Scholar</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Phantoms of those who once studied here, pace the upper galleries murmuring forgotten theories. Their ghostly
        forms
        flicker with each step, trailing ink-blot shadows and wisps of torn parchment.
    </p>

    <h3>Arcane Wisps</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Drift like motes of light caught in gravitational eddies, attracted to any source of magical energy. They spark
        with
        celestial hues and may assist or hinder explorers, depending on their chaotic whims.
    </p>

    <h3>Verdant Slime</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Seep from cracked stone and overgrown roots, absorbing ambient magic and nutrients from the decaying tower. Slow
        and
        ponderous, they glow faintly with bioluminescence and leave trails of creeping vines in their wake.
    </p>

    <h3>Clockwork Scribe</h3>
    <p class="capital">
        Spider-like automatons etched with glowing runes, patrol the lower archives, endlessly transcribing illegible
        glyphs
        into decaying tomes. Some say they record the thoughts of the stars themselves.
